## M2 — Storage layer (BigQuery + SQLite)

- **Status**: ✅ done
- **Commit SHA**: $SHA
- **Completed**: 2026-05-17
- **What this proves (for manager)**: *"We can remember what we've already seen, so re-crawling doesn't redo work."*

**Scope**: SQLite cache schema, BQ tables created via `scripts/init_bq_tables.py`, `bq_store.py` and `local_cache.py` with upsert-by-hash semantics.

**Acceptance**:
- [x] Running init script idempotently creates the 5 BQ tables
- [x] Unit test: insert new asset
- [x] Unit test: update on hash change

## M3 — BigQuery crawler + MCP tools

- **Status**: ✅ done
- **Commit SHA**: d9d4dda
- **Completed**: 2026-05-17
- **What this proves (for manager)**: *"Point the tool at a BigQuery project and it inventories every table, view, and stored procedure — plus other agents can introspect BQ through our MCP server."*

**Scope**: crawl datasets/tables/views/routines for a given project. Implement all 6 MCP tools (spec §8). Wire crawler to use the same internal functions the MCP tools expose.

**Acceptance**:
- [x] `POST /api/crawl` with `{"bigquery": {"project_id": "..."}}` populates `assets`
- [x] BQ asset hash = sha256 of canonical JSON of `(schema + routine_body + view_query)`
- [x] MCP server `tools/list` returns all 6 tools per spec §8
- [x] Integration test against mocked BQ client passes

**Preview**: crawl a real small project; inspect `assets` table; run MCP `tools/list`

**Commit message**: `feat(m3): bigquery crawler and mcp server`

## M4 — Git crawler + file classifier

- **Status**: ✅ done
- **Commit SHA**: 9c18c6f
- **Completed**: 2026-05-17
- **What this proves (for manager)**: *"We can pull a repo and correctly identify SQL files, stored procedures, Airflow DAGs, and PySpark scripts — each gets the right downstream treatment."*

**Scope**: clone/pull repo at given branch, walk files, classify, store with content hash. Skip unchanged. Test against `https://github.com/cr21/agentic-test-data` (branch `main`).

**Classifier rules**:
- `.sql` with `CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE` → `bq_routine`
- other `.sql` → `sql_file`
- `.py` importing `airflow` → `airflow_dag`
- `.py` importing `pyspark` → `pyspark_file`
- `.py` importing `pandas` (and not pyspark/airflow) → `pandas_file`
- else → `unknown`

**Acceptance**:
- [x] Unit test for each classifier rule
- [x] Integration test against `cr21/agentic-test-data` produces expected kind breakdown (lock counts after first run)
- [x] Re-crawling same branch with no changes produces zero updates
- [x] Progress page shows "Demo repo crawled" stats per kind

**Preview**: crawl fixture repo; verify `assets` rows; screenshot Progress page

**Commit message**: `feat(m4): git crawler and classifier`

## M5 — LLM client + schemas + extractor (single asset)

- **Status**: ✅ done
- **Commit SHA**: cb597e3
- **Completed**: 2026-05-17
- **What this proves (for manager)**: *"We can ask the LLM to read one file and produce structured lineage that conforms to our schema — every time."*

**Scope**: OpenAI client with structured outputs (`strict: true`), three schemas verbatim in `app/llm/schemas.py`, extractor handling one asset end-to-end.

**Acceptance**:
- [x] `POST /api/lineage/extract/{asset_id}` synchronously runs and stores result
- [x] Recorded-fixture test: one SQL file produces schema-valid STM
- [x] Recorded-fixture test: one Airflow DAG produces schema-valid DAG spec
- [x] Recorded-fixture test: one PySpark file produces schema-valid PySpark STM
- [x] Schema-validation retry path covered by test (inject bad first response)

**Preview**: hit endpoint for 3 fixture assets; inspect `lineage_results`

**Commit message**: `feat(m5): llm lineage extractor`

## M6 — Edge explosion + depth-2 resolver

- **Status**: ✅ done
- **Commit SHA**: 9b9f53c
- **Completed**: 2026-05-17
- **What this proves (for manager)**: *"If table B comes from A, which comes from C, we surface C as B's real source — even when the pipeline spans multiple files."*

**Scope**: flatten `lineage_results.payload` into `lineage_edges` (depth 1), compute depth-2 edges with cycle detection.

**Acceptance**:
- [x] Unit test: simple A→B
- [x] Unit test: chain C→A→B produces depth-2 row C→B
- [x] Unit test: diamond shape resolves correctly
- [x] Unit test: cycle does not loop forever
- [x] Runs in O(edges) per asset

**Preview**: query `lineage_edges` for a chained fixture; verify depth-2 rows

**Commit message**: `feat(m6): edge resolver with depth-2 transitive lineage`

## M7 — Async job queue

- **Status**: ✅ done
- **Commit SHA**: 9b351fb
- **Completed**: 2026-05-17
- **What this proves (for manager)**: *"Crawls return instantly, lineage runs in the background, and users can re-trigger any asset on demand without waiting on others."*

**Scope**: in-process asyncio queue, semaphore-bounded workers, job lifecycle in `lineage_jobs`, auto-enqueue after crawl, on-demand endpoint.

**Acceptance**:
- [x] `POST /api/crawl` returns immediately with run_id; jobs enqueued for changed assets
- [x] `POST /api/lineage/refresh/{asset_id}` enqueues fresh job
- [x] `GET /api/lineage/jobs?status=...` lists jobs
- [x] Staleness: skip if `input_hash == content_hash` and non-failed result exists
- [x] Test: concurrency limit honored
- [x] Test: staleness skip works
- [x] Test: on-demand always runs (bypasses staleness)

**Preview**: crawl; watch jobs progress via jobs endpoint

**Commit message**: `feat(m7): async lineage job queue`

## M8 — Streamlit UI (full)

- **Status**: ✅ done
- **Commit SHA**: aaa6c5a
- **Completed**: 2026-05-17
- **What this proves (for manager)**: *"The whole thing is usable end-to-end through a UI — crawl, browse, preview lineage in a table, drill into transitive sources."*

**Scope**: four pages per spec §7 — Progress (already exists, enhanced), Crawl, Assets, Preview. Polling status; STM/DAG/PySpark variant table layouts; depth-2 panel on Preview.

**Acceptance**:
- [x] Crawl page kicks off crawl and shows progress
- [x] Assets page filters and sorts
- [x] Preview page renders STM variant correctly
- [x] Preview page renders DAG spec variant correctly
- [x] Preview page renders PySpark STM variant correctly
- [x] Preview page shows depth-2 panel where transitive edges exist
- [x] `tests/ui_checklist.md` written and passes 5-minute click-through with no Python errors

- **What this proves (for manager)**: *"The whole pipeline works on a fresh machine following a README — and we have a single test that proves it."*

**Scope**: integration test crawling fixture repo + mocked BQ project, running full pipeline, asserting on `lineage_edges`. Structured logging. UI error surfaces. `README.md` quickstart.

**Acceptance**:
- [x] `pytest tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py` passes
- [x] README quickstart works on a fresh machine
- [x] Errors in lineage jobs are visible in UI

## Notes

- **Update procedure**: when starting a milestone, flip ⬜ → 🟡. When committing, flip 🟡 → ✅, fill `Commit SHA` (use `git rev-parse --short HEAD` after committing, then `git commit --amend`), fill `Completed` with `YYYY-MM-DD`, check off acceptance boxes.
- **The "Active milestone" line at the top is updated alongside the status flips** — keep it in sync.
- **If blocked**, flip to ❌ and write the blocker under that milestone's section.
